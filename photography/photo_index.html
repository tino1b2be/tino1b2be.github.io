    <p class="text">Early 2015 when i decided to take up a hobby that had nothing to do with the computer. Sitting on the computer all day watching movies, series, etc can be boring and also unhealthy sometimes. This was enough of an excuse to spend some cash on a DSLR and the adventures began.
    <br />Most of my images displayed here were captured using the Canon EOS 500D (Rebel Ti1 or Kiss X3) and I post them on <a href="https://instagram.com/tino1b2be">Instagram</a> and <a href="hhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/tino1b2be">Flickr</a>.
